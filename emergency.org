* Department of State v. Aids Vaccine Advocacy Coalition // https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a269_bp7c.pdf
- The administration moved to impound $4 billion dollars in aid funding. Plaintiffs are recipients of the funding. They brought an APA claim asking the court to order the executive to spend congressionally approriated funds totally $10.5 billion dollars, including the $4 billion the administration is seeking to impound.
- The DDC ordered defendants to: not implement any of their terminations, suspension, or stop-work orders; not withold payments for work completed; not "unlawfully impound[] congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds"; and they must spend the full amount of fund appropriated by congress.
